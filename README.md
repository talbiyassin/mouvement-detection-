# mouvement-detection-
This code analyzes a video file for moving objects and highlights them in a rectangle with text indicating "sesama student detected". It accomplishes this by subtracting the background frame from the current frame and applying thresholding to detect changes in pixel intensity. The resulting image is then dilated to make the changes more prominent and contours are detected. If a contour has an area greater than 1500 pixels, it is considered a moving object and a rectangle is drawn around it with the specified text. The processed video is displayed in a window with the moving objects highlighted in real-time.
